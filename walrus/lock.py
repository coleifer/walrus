class Lock(object):
    """
    Lock implementation. Can also be used as a context-manager or
    decorator.

    Unlike the redis-py lock implementation, this Lock does not
    use a spin-loop when blocking to acquire the lock. Instead,
    it performs a blocking pop on a list. When a lock is released,
    a value is pushed into this list, signalling that the lock is
    available.

    The lock uses Lua scripts to ensure the atomicity of its
    operations.

    You can set a TTL on a lock to reduce the potential for deadlocks
    in the event of a crash. If a lock is not released before it
    exceeds its TTL, and threads that are blocked waiting for the
    lock could potentially re-acquire it.

    .. note:: TTL is specified in **milliseconds**.

    Locks can be used as context managers or as decorators:

    .. code-block:: python

        lock = db.lock('my-lock')

            perform_some_calculations()

            # called, and released when the function returns.

        accomplished by performing a blocking left-pop on a list, as
        opposed to a spin-loop.
