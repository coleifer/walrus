    """
    Lock implementation. Can also be used as a context-manager or
    decorator.

    Unlike the redis-py lock implementation, this Lock does not
    use a spin-loop when blocking to acquire the lock. Instead,
    it performs a blocking pop on a list. When a lock is released,
    a value is pushed into this list, signalling that the lock is
    available.

    The lock uses Lua scripts to ensure the atomicity of its
    operations.

    You can set a TTL on a lock to reduce the potential for deadlocks
    in the event of a crash. If a lock is not released before it
    exceeds its TTL, and threads that are blocked waiting for the
    lock could potentially re-acquire it.

    .. note:: TTL is specified in **milliseconds**.

    Locks can be used as context managers or as decorators:

    .. code-block:: python

        lock = db.lock('my-lock')

            # called, and released when the function returns.

        by calling :py:meth:`Lock.release`. If the lock was
        initialized with a ``ttl``, then the lock will be released
        automatically after the given number of milliseconds.

        By default this method will block until the lock becomes
        free (either by being released or expiring). The blocking is
        accomplished by performing a blocking left-pop on a list, as
        opposed to a spin-loop.
